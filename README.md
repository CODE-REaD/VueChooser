# VueChooser
Revised Vue Color Chooser.

This web app is running at http://vue-colors2.code-read.com.

Same application as [CanJS-ColorChooser](https://github.com/CODE-REaD/CanJS-ColorChooser), but coded in Vue for comparison.

Same application as [VueColorChooser](https://github.com/CODE-REaD/VueColorChooser), but with code simplified to leverage Vue [computed properties(https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/computed.html#Computed-Properties).
